/*
Q3). Write a base class Computer that contains data members of wordsize(in bits), memorysize
(in megabytes), storagesize (in megabytes) and speed (in megahertz). Derive a Laptop class that is
a kind of computer but also specifies the objectâ€™s length, width, height, and weight. Member
functions for both classes should include a default constructor, a constructor to inialize all
components and a function to display data members.
